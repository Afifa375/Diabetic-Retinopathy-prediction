# Diabetic-Retinopathy-prediction
AI/ML model for diabetic retinopathy detection using retinal images

This project is a **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection web application** built using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**. The app allows users to upload retina images and predicts the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Features

- Upload retina images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- Predict diabetic retinopathy stages:  
  - No DR  
  - Mild  
  - Moderate  
  - Severe  
  - Proliferative DR
- Display confidence percentage of predictions.
- Simple and interactive web interface with Streamlit.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone <repository-url>
cd diabetic-retinopathy-prediction

**##Dataset**

The model was trained on retina images labeled according to diabetic retinopathy stages. You can check the model_training.ipynb for details on preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
